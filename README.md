# Modern Angular with Signals: The Missing Guide

A focused deep-dive into modern Angular development powered by **Signals**, illuminating the latest features, best practices, and architectural evolution shaping Angular 19–20.

## What’s Inside

- **Understanding Signals**
  - Learn why Angular is shifting toward *zoneless change detection* using signals.
  - Explore core primitives: writable signals, computed signals, effects, and their interplay with dependency injection.
  - Discover advanced APIs like `linkedSignal`, and underpinning implementation details that empower more predictable reactivity.

- **Modern Component Design**
  - Integrate signals directly into Angular components to enhance performance and reduce complexity.
  - Embrace the standalone architecture and functional component APIs—moving beyond decorators.
  - Understand how Angular 18’s signal-based component API elevates maintainability in modern apps.

- **Signal-Based Services**
  - Build reactive services using signal patterns.
  - Work with `resource` and `rxResource` APIs introduced in Angular 19.
  - Learn to fetch, cache, and react to HTTP and WebSocket data streams—optimized for Angular 20’s resource APIs.

## Who This Is For

- Angular developers seeking to adopt the *new reactive paradigm* featured in Angular 19–20.
- Users familiar with traditional RxJS-based architecture looking to transition to signal-driven patterns.
- Developers interested in optimizing change detection, wiring cleaner components, and leveraging the latest Angular tooling.

## Why It Stands Out

- Helps you understand *why* Angular is moving toward a zoneless, signal-centric architecture.
- Enables building components and services with simpler, more intuitive reactive flows.
- Equips you with practical strategies for working with signals—and avoiding common pitfalls—through real-world patterns and examples.
